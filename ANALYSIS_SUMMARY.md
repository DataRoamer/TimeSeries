- **Period**: July 1, 2014 - January 31, 2015 (7 months)
- **Range**: 8 to 39,197 trips per 30-minute interval
- **Average**: 15,138 trips per 30-minute interval
- **Quality**: No missing values, no duplicates, clean data

## 🔍 Key Patterns Discovered

### Daily Patterns
- **Peak Hours**: 7:00 PM (22,892 avg trips), 6:00 PM, 8:00 PM
- **Quiet Hours**: 5:00 AM (3,583 avg trips), 4:00 AM, 3:00 AM
- **Rush Hour Ratio**: 6.4x higher demand at peak vs minimum

### Weekly Patterns
